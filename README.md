### Pymap.py

> This is a python script that will first quickly scan all 65535 tcp ports.
>
> It will then run an agressive scan: Arguments: -A, -sCV, -T4 against the open ports.
>
> Finally is will store the results in the current working directory with the file name 'nmap-all-tcp.nmap'
>
> User will be asked to input the IP as an input for the script.
